What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, a hidden git file is created. This is used to track the changes
made by the users of the repository. You need to initialize the repository inorder to have version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is a file in the system. Staging area acts as an intermidiary between repository and working directory.
Repository contains the final commits and change. The main advantage of staging area
it acts as a shield between repository and working directory preventing us from commiting a file carelessly

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use git diff --staged to see the changes you made and if you have more than one logical change try to differentiate each logical change
and commit one at a time.
