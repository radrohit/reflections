When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your repository with other users and when you have made a substantial change. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In a project, a user might make changes to local repository without pushing it to the remote repository. 
There will be changes added to github by other users and it will become tedious for 
you and github to clarify these changes.
